# A modular toolkit for kinect-powered games.

### Requiring Dendrobium:

__Staples__: Commonly used shader functions, including an efficient and flexible blur.

__Poltergeist__: Faking depth with the mouse for development

__Sensei__: Virtual sensors or "colliders."
	Currently supports only rectangles. Optimized for small numbers of large, uniquely sized colliders, not for a grid.
	
__Yoda__: Depth generates a "force" which can be used to push or pull objects

### Self-contained:

__Vector__: Vector operations on 2d arrays and other helpful math.

__Kalimba__: Play sounds at dynamic volume and speed/pitch.

__Newton__: Circular physics objects. Combine with Yoda to make them interactive.

__Burdock__: Objects that "track" people by sticking to depth. Best used with Yoda.

__Zenith__: Help with 1 point perspective.
